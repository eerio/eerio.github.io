<ul>
<li>You can’t start with inventing something good</li>
<li>To begin with, you need to be inspired by someone</li>
<li>If you dress as well as a fashion brand model, that’s probably enough
<ul>
<li><ol type="a">
<li>Find the vibe we want to achieve. My plan is to establish what the fashion frontline is, find people/institutions (e.g., fashion magazines) who set it</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="2" type="a">
<li>If we have selected styles that we like - what are the chances that if we dress exactly the same, it will look good? -&gt; we need to examine how to match clothes to our body type</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="3" type="a">
<li>How to determine our body type?</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="4" type="a">
<li>What is the psychology of types of clothing? Colors? What stereotypes will we achieve by wearing a particular item?</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="5" type="a">
<li>It will be difficult to find interesting clothes. That’s why we need to have a very well-developed quality basic style</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="6" type="a">
<li>Know color theory. How to match clothes, colors</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="7" type="a">
<li>It’s easy to buy basic clothes - buy them, focus primarily on quality, e.g., materials used.</li>
</ol></li>
<li><ol start="8" type="a">
<li>Quality basic clothes are a very good investment - these are everyday things, easy to use, potentially very valuable, and lasting for years with practically zero maintenance cost</li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
