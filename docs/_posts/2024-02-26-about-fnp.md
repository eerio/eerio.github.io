FO[BIT] = FO[+, x] = AC0

all NPC search problems reduce to their decision problems

if EE (i.e. DTIME(2^{2^O(n)})) neq NEE, then there is a problem in NP
such that no corresponding FNP problem can be reduced to it
https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~mihir/papers/compip.pdf

Impagliazzo and Sudan proved the same, under the assumption that NE neq coNE
NE = NTIME(2^O(n))


For a start, the following is FP-complete: given a constant Boolean circuit with multiple output nodes, compute its output. You may further restrict it to monotone circuits. More generally, if L
 is any P-complete language (under logspace many-one reductions), then the following problem is FP-complete (under logspace parsimonious reductions): given a sequence of inputs, compute the sequence of bits indicating which of the inputs are in L
