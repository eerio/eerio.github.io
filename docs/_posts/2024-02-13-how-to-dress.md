title: How to Dress?
---

- You can't start with inventing something good
- To begin with, you need to be inspired by someone
- If you dress as well as a fashion brand model, that's probably enough
  - a) Find the vibe we want to achieve. My plan is to establish what the fashion frontline is, find people/institutions (e.g., fashion magazines) who set it
  - b) If we have selected styles that we like - what are the chances that if we dress exactly the same, it will look good? -> we need to examine how to match clothes to our body type
  - c) How to determine our body type?
  - d) What is the psychology of types of clothing? Colors? What stereotypes will we achieve by wearing a particular item?
  - e) It will be difficult to find interesting clothes. That's why we need to have a very well-developed quality basic style
  - f) Know color theory. How to match clothes, colors
  - g) It's easy to buy basic clothes - buy them, focus primarily on quality, e.g., materials used.
  - h) Quality basic clothes are a very good investment - these are everyday things, easy to use, potentially very valuable, and lasting for years with practically zero maintenance cost
